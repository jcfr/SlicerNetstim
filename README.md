This branch contains only the CLI modules of the Extension.

The [custom Slicer app for Lead-DBS](https://github.com/netstim/SlicerForLeadDBS) includes this branch in the build.

The scripted modules are loaded when launching the custom app from Lead-DBS.

This design was chosen to be able to update the scripted modules without building the custom app every time.
